# Shared Play

Shared play is an Android app that allows users to create and share playlists, as well as leave private comments on individual songs or music videos within a playlist. 
Friends can listen to the same music and also share their impressions and reactions in a private, video-specific thread. 

# Screenshots

Shared play currently has four different screens that each serve a distinct purpose. You can take a look at the screenshots below for better understanding.
